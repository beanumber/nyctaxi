NYC's [Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) Trip Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/html/about/trip_record_data.shtml) is a collection of green and yellow taxi trip records including fields capturing pick-up and drop-off locations, times, trip distances, fares, rate types, and driver-reported passenger counts. The data was collected and provided to the NYC TLC by technology providers under the Taxicab & Livery Passenger Enhancement Programs.
